        <section class="content"><p>This guide goes over some useful details regarding Koding Apps. What they are,
how to use them, and how to fix a broken install. We will not go over
App Creation at this time, but there will be a guide for that in the&nbsp;future!</p>
<h2 id="video">Video</h2>
<p><em>(None yet, coming&nbsp;soon!)</em></p>
<h2 id="what-are-koding-apps?">What are Koding&nbsp;Apps?</h2>
<p>Think of Koding Apps like Desktop Applications, on Koding. They can be
anything from simple shortcuts such as installing PureFTPd or MySQL,
to complicated apps such as real Image Editing and Realtime&nbsp;Collaboration.</p>
<h3 id="installing-apps">Installing&nbsp;Apps</h3>
<p>Installation is quite simple. Navigate to <a href="https://koding.com/Apps">koding/Apps</a> and find the app
you want. Click on the desired app, and click the green <strong>“Install Now”</strong>
button under the App&nbsp;title.</p>
<p>In a moment, once the App installs, you will be directed to
<a href="https://koding.com/Develop">koding/Develop</a> which shows a list of your installed Apps. To use one,
simple click on&nbsp;it!</p>
<p>Each app will be different, but generally if it‘s an installer like
PureFTPd, it will have an install option in the upper right. If it’s an
app that you use, just click on it and use it&nbsp;:D</p>
<h2 id="apps,-the-nitty-gritty-details">Apps, The nitty gritty&nbsp;details</h2>
<p>So, what <em>are</em> Apps you ask? Are they run on the server? Are they run on the
client? It&#39;s kind of important to know if you want to develop them&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>Koding Apps are basically clientside Apps that use the Koding Framework
to communicate with your <span class="caps">VM</span>. This means that potentially any web based
and modular html/js/css app can be turned into a Koding App with some
love! You can see this in the Koding Text editor. It&#39;s basically just the
Ace Editor wrapped in the Koding&nbsp;Framework.</p>
<p>So keep an eye out for cool web platforms, chances are good that in
the future we can integrate it into&nbsp;Koding!</p>
<h2 id="app-development">App&nbsp;Development</h2>
<p>There are no published api docs currently, which makes development a bit
hard. There are however, two Apps designed to help you develop Koding Apps.
<a href="https://koding.com/Apps/kodepad">Kodepad</a> and <a href="https://koding.com/Apps/appmaker">Appmaker</a>. It‘s mostly just code examples, but it’s the
best we currently&nbsp;have.</p>
<p>In the future, when i understand App Development more, i&#39;ll be making a
guide on the subject. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/koding/docs/issues/new">contact me</a> if you&#39;d like to
contribute&nbsp;:)</p>
<h2 id="app-submission">App&nbsp;Submission</h2>
<p>So, you made an awesome app and you want to submit it right? You can read up 
on the process for basic app submission <a href="/docs/guides/app-submission">here</a>.</p>

<p>Koding changes quite rapidly, so if one of these guides are outdated,
or if something just doesn&#39;t quite make sense to you, please
<a href="https://github.com/koding/docs/issues/new">submit an issue</a> on the matter. Doing this will help me keep these guides
up to date, and help any Koders using these guides after you. Thanks!</p>
