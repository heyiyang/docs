        <section class="content"><p>Koding is an online development environment with the goal of simplifying
worldwide development and providing free computation and development to&nbsp;everyone.</p>
<p>It does this by offering Free VMs for development to anyone.
The Koding VMs provide you with a <em>real</em> Ubuntu <span class="caps">OS</span>, with a <em>real</em> Terminal,
and allow you to work on <em>real</em> code. Python, <span class="caps">PHP</span>, C++, C, it doesn&#39;t matter.
Even better, they are online. Accessible from anywhere in the world. Even
sharable with&nbsp;teams.</p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t heard of Koding, <a href="https://koding.com/">click here</a> and go check it&nbsp;out!</p>

<h2 id="is-koding-a-production-host?">Is Koding a Production&nbsp;Host?</h2>
<p>Koding is first and foremost a Development Environment. All features have been
tailored with this in mind and evidence of this is reflected in all of the
features you see implemented. Lets highlight some of these&nbsp;items.</p>
<h3 id="vms-shutdown-after-logout">VMs Shutdown After&nbsp;Logout</h3>
<p>Approximately 20 minutes after you log out, your Free VMs will shut down. Why?
Koding‘s development focus is not centered around hosting your blog/site.
Koding is here to enable you and to help you make great things. Attempting
to be yet another host in a sea of perfectly capable production hosts
won’t help achieve that&nbsp;goal.</p>
<p>Another benefit of this system, is that it helps avoid security concerns that
collectively harm us all. There are plenty of users out there who have used
Koding to host dangerous applications. Phishing, scamming, spamming, all
of it. This directly harms all of us, by giving Koding a bad name,
wasting resources, and hindering a service that we are trying to be productive
with. It&#39;s no surprise that restrictions need to be put in place to inhibit
this behavior, for the benefit of&nbsp;everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the future Paid Always-On VMs will be an option. This is
currently not available&nbsp;though.</p>
<h3 id="cpu-bursts-vs-sustained"><span class="caps">CPU</span> Bursts vs&nbsp;Sustained</h3>
<p>Koding wants to help you get work done, and get work done fast. Things like
compilers have a lot to compute, but in short sporadic bursts. Koding&#39;s <span class="caps">CPU</span>
allocation has been tailored with this in mind. It wants you to compute what
you need, as soon as possible. It is not tailored for a long running
process that expect heavy and consistent usage, such as a Minecraft&nbsp;server.</p>
<h3 id="raw-ubuntu-os">Raw Ubuntu&nbsp;<span class="caps">OS</span></h3>
<p>These days a lot of hosting platforms are heavily optimized for
their specific niche(s). They streamline the process of hosting your
language or application style of choice, which gives you added
stability and performance gains. Examples of this are the plethora
of Apache-<span class="caps">PHP</span> hosts, Nodejitsu, Google App Engine, Heroku, AppFog,
and a nearly limitless amount of&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>Why is this? Well, production hosting is hard, and there are obvious
benefits to letting someone else do it. The idea of uploading your
php site to a standard php host is easy. The idea of buying a
dedicated server, setting up Apache, firewalls, updates, etc, just
seems a bit crazy in comparison. On top of that, what about
load balancing and CDNs? Doing it all yourself can be&nbsp;hard.</p>
<p>Well, Koding gives you that raw machine. It‘s not trying to make
production hosting for you, but rather it’s giving you a completely
open and powerful environment to <em>make stuff</em>! So by all means
<em>make</em> your Wordpress blog on Koding, and if you really want
to host it on Koding wait a while and buy an Always-On <span class="caps">VM</span>. Just
be aware of the design&nbsp;goals.</p>

<p>Koding changes quite rapidly, so if one of these guides are outdated,
or if something just doesn&#39;t quite make sense to you, please
<a href="https://github.com/koding/docs/issues/new">submit an issue</a> on the matter. Doing this will help me keep these guides
up to date, and help any Koders using these guides after you. Thanks!</p>
